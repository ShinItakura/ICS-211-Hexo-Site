A little about myself. 

I am a second year Information and Computer Systems student at Camosun College working towards a diploma for use in the technology field.

My skills have been developed to include the use and configuration Mac OS, Microsoft Windows and Windows Server operating systems. I am also very comfortable working with Linux distributions mainly Ubuntu, Kali, Ubuntu Terminal Server, Raspian, and CentOS. During the past year I have become capable using Oracle SQL, SQL 92/99, MySQL workbench and SQL developer for database management. Java, Bash, Shell, and python are the main programming languages that I have be taught over the past year. For website and webapp development I was taught to use and deploy with HTML5, CSS, JSON, Javascript, JQuery, and PHP. In group or personal projects, I have comfortably used git, git-hub, and git-lab for version control and development. I enjoy problem-solving in a fast-paced environment, meeting deadlines, and I am team oriented and like to add input to help out colleagues.

Currently, as a second year student at Camosun College, I have been employed to help or tutor the new intake of students into the program. Coding and troubleshooting systems for the first year student are my current responsibilities. On occasion I am tasked to help Camosuns IT support with hardware and software installations.
